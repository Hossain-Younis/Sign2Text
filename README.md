# Sign2Text

Sign2Text is a deep neural network based on CNNClassifier algorithm which can recognize Alphabets, 0 to 9, del (Delete), nothing, space in ASL (American Sign Language).

## Accuracy

The model has an accuracy close to 95% (approximately 93.654%) in recognizing all the signs mentioned

## Extra

I have also included a notebook on how to make model access the camera. The model file is available in both Legacy .h5 formal as well as the modern .keras format

I hope this project of mine has positive impact on society and I'll try to improve and teach the model other things in the future too ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
